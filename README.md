# Restaurant Reviews App: Stage 1

## Project Description

This project has been created as part of Udacity's Front End Web Developer nanodegree course. According to the project instructions I incrementally had to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. The starting point was a static design lacking accessibility and I had to convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience.

## How to run the application

Download or clone the repository:

`https://github.com/krisztinamagyari/restaurant-review-app.git`

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`. For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
